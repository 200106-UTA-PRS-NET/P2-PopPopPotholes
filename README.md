# P2-PopPopPotholes
Popping Potholes Off of the Stack!

PopPopPotholes is a web app that makes it easy for citizens to communicate with local governing bodies about infrastructure and waste management concerns. Citizens, being regular users in this case, will be able to open the PopPopPotholes website on their phones, take a picture of the issue that they find, fill out the severity level of the issue, and submit it for city officials to investigate. These city officials will then be able to log into admin accounts for their respective cities and delegate the issue to the appropriate department (for example, construction).
    PopPopPotHoles will implement the Geolocation API. This will allow the app to select the nearest city based on a regular userâ€™s location when they are submitting an issue. Using the location in this way also prevents users from spamming a given city with false issues.
